# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease **classification**.

For example, given a person's health characteristics, we're going to build a model to predict whether or not they have heart disease.

It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.
